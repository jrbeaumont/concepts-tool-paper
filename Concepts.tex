\begin{abstract}
Asynchronous circuits are becoming increasingly important in
system design, where they orchestrate
the interface between synchronous computation components
and the analogue environment.
However, wide adoption of asynchronous circuits by industrial users is
hindered by a steep learning curve for asynchronous control models,
such as Signal Transition Graphs, that are developed by the academic
community for specification, verification and synthesis of
asynchronous circuits.

Previously, we have introduced a novel high-level description language
for asynchronous circuits, which is based on behavioural
\textit{concepts} -- high-level descriptions of asynchronous circuit
requirements.
In this paper we will discuss our open-source tool, \noun{Plato} 
which allows the specification of asynchronous circuits using concepts, and 
features the ability to automatically translate these to Signal Transition 
Graphs for further processing by conventional asynchronous EDA 
tools, such as \noun{Petrify} and \noun{Mpsat}.

\section{Introduction}

\vspace{-1mm}

\emph{Concepts} have been presented in order to provide a more compact
and intuitive method of designing asynchronous circuits, using a fully
compositional description method. Composition is an 
important part of concepts and the use of composition in some algebraic 
representations, such as with DI algebra~\cite{270632}, Conditional Signal 
Graphs~\cite{6243877} and Algebra of Parameterised Graphs~\cite{2014_mokhov_pg} helped to inspire this. 

As discussed in~\cite{2015_Beaumont_MEMOCODE}, concepts are a useful language 
for specifying the behaviours of asynchronous circuits, in the preferred form 
of the user. This can be as low-level signal-level concepts, or higher-level 
gate- or protocol-level concepts. It also allows the definition of their own 
concepts, which can be reused within the same or any other specification that 
they wish to increase the speed of designing a system, and future systems. 

With concepts, we aim to solve the problems that can arise from the more 
commonly used monolithic approach with Signal Transition Graphs (STGs)~\cite{Chu_1987_phd}\cite{Rosenblum_1985_tpn},
where a user must design each system in the 
form of an STG from a blank page. The scalability of this is poor: as the 
system grows in complexity its monolithic specification becomes challenging to 
comprehend and debug. When the number of signals increases, the gates and 
protocols describing the interactions between some signals become difficult to
include with each occurrence of these signals.

%\protect\caption{\label{fig:cElement-stg} Example STG}
%%\vspace{-6mm}
%\end{figure}
%
%For example, Figure~\ref{fig:cElement-stg} contains an STG. 
%While it seems fairly simple, it would be useful to know that this features a C-element,
%and the environment of this is simply an inverter from the output, $c$, to both inputs.
%Instead, it is possible to note that there are two handshakes formed by the signal pairs of $a$,$c$ and $b$,$c$. 
%From this information we can discern not only signal interactions, but the behavioural
%relationships of these signals. 

STGs are supported by multiple electronic design automation~(EDA) tools for verification and synthesis 
of asynchronous control circuits,
such as \noun{Petrify}~\cite{Cortadella}, \noun{Mpsat}~\cite{khomenko2004detecting}, 
\noun{Versify}~\cite{i1997formal}, 
\noun{Workcraft}~\cite{Sokolov-2016-book-Workcraft}\cite{Workcraft_website}, 
and others. These tools take an STG specification and can formally verify its correctness, 
as well as synthesize an asynchronous circuit implementation that is 
\emph{speed-independent}, i.e. guaranteed to work correctly regardless of 
component delays~\cite{Muller_1959_ts}.

Concepts are not supported by these tools, and rather than
authoring tools to verify and synthesize concepts directly, which is a time 
consuming process, we can \emph{translate} concepts to STGs, for use with these
existing tools.

In this paper, we will discuss the implementation of the domain specific 
language and translation tool for concepts, implemented in \noun{Haskell}, called 
\noun{Plato}~\cite{2016_concepts_github}.
If STGs are the assembly language of asynchronous circuits, \noun{Plato} is a 
compiler from a higher-level language, concepts, to this assembler. \noun{Plato} is 
integrated into \noun{Workcraft}~\cite{Workcraft_website}, an open-source 
EDA tool which also features some verification and synthesis tools for STGs.

The contributions of this paper are:
%\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We detail the notations of concepts within \noun{Plato} and the built in
  concepts and their uses in Section~\ref{sec:tool-func}.
  \item We present the implemented algorithm for translating concepts to STGs
  in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}.
  \item We explain how to use the tool from within
  \noun{Workcraft} to translate concepts in Section~\ref{sec:tool-use}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Features of \noun{Plato}\label{sec:tool-func}}

%\vspace{-3mm}

The abstract base of concepts, on which asynchronous circuit specifications 
is founded, is discussed in~\cite{2015_Beaumont_MEMOCODE}.

\vspace{-1mm}

\subsection{Concept notation \label{sub:concept-notation}}

%\vspace{-3.5mm}

Concepts can be composed of other concepts, and this applies to the behaviours 
of signals, as well as the specification of the initial states and the signal 
types. This allows there to be different levels of concepts, each level of 
which will feature a composition of concepts from a lower level. In this section we will explain these levels, and the standard notations of 
concepts for these. 

%\vspace{-3mm}

\subsubsection{\label{signal-level}Signal-level concepts}Asynchronous circuit 
specifications are mainly composed of signal transitions, and interactions 
between these, to show causal relationships. Signal transitions are denoted as 
$a^{+}$ and $a^{-}$, where $a$ is any signal name, and 
the $+$ or $-$ indicates which way this signal transitions, $+$ denoting a 
low-to-high or 0 to 1 transition, and $-$ denoting a high-to-low, 1 to 0 
transition. 

\noun{Plato} is written in Haskell, a functional programming language. The 
domain specific language which we have implemented therefore uses Haskell 
notations, and this means some notations are different to standard signal 
transition specifications. $a^{+}$ and $a^{-}$ are in post-fix notation, where 
the operator is stated after the operand. Haskell does not support post-fix 
notation, and as such, we have to use a differing signal transition notation. 

In \noun{Plato}, signal transitions $a^{+}$ and $a^{-}$ are noted as \mintinline{haskell}{rise a} and 
\mintinline{haskell}{fall a} respectively. We will use the tool notation in code examples, but describe these using standard notation in the text

Signal-level concepts are the base level of concepts, and are 
the type all other concepts are built on. Here we display the standard concepts
available at this level.

A key concept in asynchronous circuits is \emph{causality}:
one signal transition \emph{causes} another signal transition, a cause and an 
effect. This is denoted in the form: 

\vspace{-1.5mm}

\begin{center}
{\mintinline{haskell}{rise a} \mintinline{haskell}{~>} \mintinline{haskell}{rise c}}
\end{center}

\vspace{-1.5mm}

This is read as $a^{+}$ causes $c^{+}$, meaning that for the $c^{+}$ transition 
to occur, $a^{+}$ must have occurred previously. The operator
\mintinline{haskell}{~>}
is used to show causal relationships between signals.
 
%While this concept is called \emph{causality}, this doesn't necessarily imply
%timings, such as any \emph{cause} transition immediately forcing the
%\emph{effect} transition it applies to. Causality can be used in order to
%list all possible \emph{cause} transitions which need to occur in order
%for an \emph{effect} transition.

One can compose any concepts using the
operator \mintinline{haskell}{<>}, and this applies
to concepts of any level, whether predefined or user-defined. For example, 
two causality concepts can be composed.

\vspace{-1.5mm}

\begin{center}
\mintinline{haskell}{rise a} \mintinline{haskell}{~>} \mintinline{haskell}{rise c} \mintinline{haskell}{<>} \mintinline{haskell}{rise b} \mintinline{haskell}{~>} \mintinline{haskell}{rise c}
\end{center}

\vspace{-2mm}

In words, $a^{+}$ \emph{and} $b^{+}$ must occur before $c^{+}$ can occur. 
This corresponds to so-called AND-causality in the fact that several cause 
transitions \emph{must all} have occurred before an event can occur. 
AND-causality is commonly used to imply behaviours in circuits, for specific 
requirements of effect transitions.  

The above notation can cause long-winded specifications when lots of 
AND-causality is involved. To solve this we provide a listing option. The 
following will achieve the same results:

\vspace{-3mm}

\begin{center}
      [\mintinline{haskell}{rise a,} \mintinline{haskell}{rise b}] \mintinline{haskell}{~&~>} \mintinline{haskell}{rise c}
\end{center}

\vspace{-1mm}

This form of concept can be composed as usual with any other concepts.

A less common, but still useful form of causality is OR-causality. This is 
where an effect transition can have several possible cause transitions. Only 
one cause transition is required to occur to allow the effect transition to 
occur. 

With OR-causality, the notation used lists all possible causes for the stated 
effect:

\vspace{-1.5mm}

\begin{center}
      [\mintinline{haskell}{rise x,} \mintinline{haskell}{rise y}] \mintinline{haskell}{~|~>} \mintinline{haskell}{rise z}
\end{center}

\vspace{-1mm}

This is, \emph{either} $x^{+}$ \emph{or} $y^{+}$ must occur in order for 
$z^{+}$ to occur. The interactions when an effect transition is included in both AND- and 
OR-causality are interesting, and an example of when this occurs can be found 
in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}.

%\vspace{-2mm}

\subsubsection{Gate-level concepts \label{subsub:gate-level}} Using the causality concept we can express
the behaviour of gates in asynchronous circuits. For example, a \emph{buffer}
is a gate with one input signal and one output signal,
whose output transitions causally depend on the input ones:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
buffer a b = rise a ~> rise b 
          <> fall a ~> fall b
\end{minted}

\noindent An \emph{inverter} has a similar conceptual specification, but the
output transition is inverted:

\vspace{-1mm}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
inverter a b = rise a ~> fall b
            <> fall a ~> rise b
\end{minted}

\vspace{-1mm}

\noindent A \emph{C-element} is a gate with two inputs, in this example $a$ and $b$, and one
output~$c$, which synchronizes both rising and falling input transitions
via AND-causality:

%\vspace{-1mm}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
cElement a b c = rise a ~> rise c 
              <> rise b ~> rise c
              <> fall a ~> fall c 
              <> fall b ~> fall c
\end{minted}

An alternative way to express the same concept is to reuse the buffer concept:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
cElement a b c = buffer a c <> buffer b c
\end{minted}

A C-element combines the constraints imposed on the output
transitions by two `virtual' buffers. Behaviour of other gates can be similarly
defined in this way. An expanded example of a C-element and other examples can 
be found in~\cite{2015_Beaumont_MEMOCODE}.

%\vspace{-2mm}

\subsubsection{Protocol-level concepts} In addition to gate-level concepts
described above it is often important to specify \emph{protocols}
of interaction between multiple gates, components or signals. Here we 
demonstrate how one can use concepts to specify asynchronous handshakes.

Given two signals $a$ and $b$, a \emph{handshake} between them is
the following composition of causality concepts:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
handshake a b = rise a ~> rise b 
             <> rise b ~> fall a 
             <> fall a ~> fall b 
             <> fall b ~> rise a
\end{minted}

Intuitively, we have a two-way asynchronous communication channel,
where one party sends transitions $a^{+}$ and $a^{-}$ and the other
party responds by corresponding $b^{+}$ and $b^{-}$ transitions.
Note that the four causality concepts match those found
in the buffer and inverter concepts, which leads to an alternative
way to express a handshake between~$a$ and~$b$:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
handshake a b = buffer a b 
             <> inverter b a
\end{minted}

This conceptual understanding of a handshake as being composed
from a buffer and an inverter is often used by circuit designers as
a convenient way of reasoning.

\vspace{-1mm}

\subsection{Concepts required for translation\label{sub:trans-concepts}}

\vspace{-1mm}

The concepts we have discussed so far are aimed at specifying the behaviour of 
signals in a circuit. When translating these to STGs however, these behaviours 
do not result in a complete specification, meaning they will not be 
verifiable by standard tools, and therefore not synthesizable.

This is due to various parts of an STG that we have not yet discussed, which 
are important for specification, namely \emph{interface} and 
\emph{initial states}.

%\vspace{-3mm}

\subsubsection{Interface concepts\label{sub:interface}} 

An important part of a specification is how these signals interact with the 
outside world, which could be another scenario or another circuit, for example.
These signals can be inputs from the outside world, outputs or an internal 
signal, which is used only within this circuit. 

To specify the type of a signal (\emph{input},
\emph{output} or \emph{internal}) we introduce the \texttt{interface} concept.
Signal types are composed according to the following rules:

\vspace{-1mm}

\[
\begin{array}{|l||l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c||}{<>} & \mathsf{Input} & \mathsf{Output} &
\mathsf{Internal} \\ \hline \hline
\mathsf{Input} & \mathsf{Input} & \mathsf{Output} & \mathsf{Internal} \\ \hline
\mathsf{Output} & \mathsf{Output} & \mathsf{Output} & \mathsf{Internal} \\
\hline
\mathsf{Internal}& \mathsf{Internal} & \mathsf{Internal} & \mathsf{Internal} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The intuition is as follows:

%\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If a signal is an input in one component of the system, but is an
    output in another component, then in the composition it will be an output.
    \item An internal signal is similar to an output signal in the sense
    that it is driven by the circuit (not the environment), but it is hidden, 
    i.e. not accessible via the circuit interface. Once a signal is hidden and 
    declared internal it cannot be revealed.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Specifying signal types is important when designing asynchronous
circuits, as it helps to quickly identify errors, for example, when an input transition is
caused by a hidden internal transition, as internal transitions are used only by the circuit 
and cannot be accessed from the environment, and as such, an internal transition cannot
cause an input transition. 

We can then reuse existing tools for circuit
simulation, verification and synthesis. Signal type information is also used
in the algorithm for automated translation of concepts to
STGs (Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}).

Concepts \texttt{inputs}, \texttt{outputs}, \texttt{internals} are defined for
specifying the type of sets of signals, and can be included in-line
with other concepts. For example, to specify that signals $a$ and $b$ are 
inputs, $c$ is an output, and $t$ is internal:

\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{center}
\mintinline{haskell}{inputs [a, b]} \mintinline{haskell}{<>} \mintinline{haskell}{outputs [c]} \\
\mintinline{haskell}{<>} \mintinline{haskell}{internals [t]}
\end{center}

\vspace{-2mm}

\subsubsection{Initial state concepts\label{sub:initState}}

Specifying the initial state is important, as it determines what the first 
transitions of a scenario will be. Without these, no transition can occur.

Each signal must have its initial state declared before translation can occur. 
In order to specify the initial state of a handshake between signals~$a$
and~$b$, we use the \mintinline{haskell}{initialise} concept.
The possible initial states are \emph{low} or \emph{high}, referred to as 
\emph{0} or \emph{1} respectively:

\vspace{-1mm}

\begin{center}
   \mintinline{haskell}{initialise a 0} \mintinline{haskell}{<>} \mintinline{haskell}{initialise x 1}
\end{center}

\vspace{-1mm}

\noindent A signal can only be declared as initially high or low. If the 
initial state of a signal is not defined, an error will occur, and the 
translation will not continue. In the event a signal has its 
initial state declared as both high and low, and is thus inconsistent, then the translation will also fail.

For ease-of-use, initial states can also be declared in lists:

\vspace{-1mm}

\begin{center}
\mintinline{haskell}{initialise0[a, b, c]} \mintinline{haskell}{<>} \mintinline{haskell}{initialise1[x,y]}
\end{center}

%\vspace{-2mm}

\section{Concepts to STG translation algorithm\label{sec:algorithm}}

%\vspace{-2mm}

%In order to reuse the tools developed by the community, it is
%necessary to be able to automatically translate concept specifications to STGs.
In this section, we will display an example of how the translation algorithm 
operates, and present a pseudocode form in Algorithm~\ref{alg:translation}. 

\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

      \State \textbf{read-arc} (place $t$.signalName$0$, $e$)
    \EndFor
  \EndIf
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Images/cElement-stg.pdf}
\par\end{centering}
\protect\caption{\label{fig:cElement-stg} Example STG}
\vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure}


We will use a C-element with environment example, which features two inputs to a C-element, $a$ and $b$, and the output
of this, $c$, connected to the input of an inverter, the output of which is used to drive the inputs, $a$ and $b$.
For reference, a simplified STG of this is featured in Figure~\ref{fig:cElement-stg}.


Working from this STG, one could describe the low-level operations by inputs and outputs:

%\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
circuit a b c = protocol <> ports 
             <> init
 where
  protocol = outRise <> outFall 
          <> inRise <> inFall
  outRise  = [rise a,rise b] ~&~> rise c
  outFall  = [fall a,fall b] ~&~> fall c
  inRise   = fall c ~> rise a 
          <> fall c ~> rise b
  inFall   = rise c ~> fall a 
          <> rise c ~> fall b
  ports    = inputs [a, b] 
          <> outputs [c]
  init     = initialise0 [a, b, c]
\end{minted}

%\vspace{1mm}

\noindent This provides four separate behavioural concepts, \mintinline{haskell}{outRise} and \mintinline{haskell}{outFall}
which describe how the outputs transition, and
\mintinline{haskell}{inRise} and \mintinline{haskell}{inFall}, describing how the inputs transition. These are good
to describe the low-level behaviour of each signal in relation to the other signals, but this concept specification
is fairly long. 

We have already defined C-element and inverter concepts
in Section~\ref{subsub:gate-level}. Therefore, we can simplify this specification, 
to use gate-level concepts instead:

%\vspace{-1mm}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
circuit a b c = protocol <> ports 
             <> init
 where
  protocol = cElement a b c 
          <> inverter c a 
          <> inverter c b
  ports    = inputs [a, b] 
          <> outputs [c]
  init     = initialise0 [a, b, c]
\end{minted}

The signal-level concepts between the signal pairs of $a$ and $c$, and $b$ and $c$
also match those of a handshake. So we can also specify the operation as:

\vspace{-1.5mm}

\begin{center}
   \mintinline{haskell}{handshake a c} \mintinline{haskell}{<>} \mintinline{haskell}{handshake b c}
\end{center}

\vspace{-1.5mm}

\noindent There can be multiple ways of representing a specification using concepts, 
however, all levels of abstraction available to the designer are built out of signal-level
concepts. Given a specification, we can therefore break down 
all gate- and protocol-level constructs into `atoms', which significantly 
simplifies the translation task. For now, we will ignore initial states and interface
concepts, and focus on the arcs only.

\begin{table}[h]
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Lists of cause transitions by effect transitions
		\label{tab:list-of-concepts}}
  \centering
\begin{tabular}[htb]{| m{2.7cm} | m{2.0cm} |}
  \hline
Causes & \, Effect \\ \hline \hline
$a^{+}$, $b^{+}$		& $c^{+}$ 	\\ \hline
$a^{-}$, $b^{-}$ 		& $c^{-}$ 	\\ \hline
$c^{-}$			& $a^{+}$ 	\\ \hline
$c^{+}$			& $a^{-}$ 	\\ \hline
$c^{-}$			& $b^{+}$ 	\\ \hline
$c^{+}$			& $b^{-}$ 	\\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \vspace{-3mm}
\end{table}

To start with we list all causes for each effect. This is performed on Line 2 of the algorithm, for every effect transition. 
These lists can be found in Table~\ref{tab:list-of-concepts}.
All of the included causalities are AND-causalities, and hence, there
is at least one single cause transitions for each effect transition. 

If OR-causality was included, the list of possible causes would be included with these
AND-causalities. For example:  $a^{+}$, $b^{+}$, $[x^{+}, y^{+}]$ causing
$c^{+}$. $x$ and $y$ are in a list of their own, and this shows OR-causality;
either $x$ or $y$ must transition high for $c^{+}$ to occur. However, this does
not account for the other AND-causalities. 

In this case, we perform the \emph{Cartesian product}~(Algorithm~\ref{alg:translation}, Line 3), which combines
all AND- and OR-causalities. For the example above, this would produce:

\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{center}

$a^{+}$, $b^{+}$, $x^{+}$ causes $c/1^{+}$

$a^{+}$, $b^{+}$, $y^{+}$ causes $c/2^{+}$

\end{center}

\vspace{-2mm}

\noindent This includes one of the OR-causality transitions with all of the 
AND-causality transitions. It also leaves us with two separate $c^{+}$ 
transitions. These are both needed in order to show the two possible 
combinations of transitions necessary for $c^{+}$, and would be included as two
separate transition objects in an STG. 

However, for the C-element with environment example, there is no OR-causality. 
We still perform the step of applying the Cartesian product to each of these 
lists of transitions for each effect transition, but the result will be the 
same as the original lists, seen in Table~\ref{tab:list-of-concepts}.

This concludes the part of the algorithm which defines the arcs
and transitions. Next, the algorithm begins to build the STGs. This is where
we start to use the initial state and interface concepts. 

First of all, the interface is defined, by listing all signals as 
$inputs$, $outputs$ or $internals$, based on the specification. This
is performed by Line 7 of the algorithm, with Line 6 ensuring every
signal has its interface declared. 

Now we need to add places for each signal. These are used to
show whether a signal has transitioned high or low at any point. 
For example a token in a $0$ place shows that this signal has 
transitioned low. The algorithm performs this on Lines 10-11.  

Now we include all of the 
transitions for each signal, high and low, and connect these to the places to form consistency loops
This ensures that all signals in this system will not repeat a same-direction transition, i.e. a signal will
not transition high, and then high again sometime later.

This is done by taking each transition, and if it is a $+$ transition, 
connecting the $0$ place for this signal to the transition, then connecting 
this transition to the $1$ place for this signal. If it is a $-$ 
transition, we connect the $1$ place for this signal to the transition, and 
connect this transition to the $0$ place.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:translation}, Lines 12-13 perform this operation for a $+$ transition,
and Lines 15-16 do the same for a $-$ transition. Line 10 ensures this is performed for 
each and every transition object for a signal.

%, and again, Line 6 ensures this applies to every signal
%in the system. 

Next, the algorithm introduces the initial states. All of the signals are 
specified to be initially 0 in this example, meaning that the first transition will be the $+$.
In the consistency loops, we need to place a token 
in each $0$ place for each signal. Lines 20-26 of the algorithm create these tokens,
with Lines 21-22 creating a token for an initially $0$ signal, and Lines 23-24 
creating a token for an initially $1$ signal. 

Finally, we can add the connections to the transitions, and cause the 
expected interaction between signals. This is done using read-arcs, which 
are arcs which require, but do not consume tokens for transitions. We
connect a read-arc from the place after a cause transition, to the effect transition object. 
For example, for \mintinline{haskell}{rise a} \mintinline{haskell}{~>} \mintinline{haskell}{rise b} we connect the place after $a^{+}$, namely $a0$,
to the transition $b^{+}$. In this case, $b^{+}$ will not occur until $a0$ contains a token,
and when it does occur, the token will remain in $a0$ following the $b^{+}$ transition. 

The read-arc connections are performed by Line 30 for a $rise$ transition, connecting the
cause signals $1$ to the effect transition object, and Line 34 connects the $0$ place of a 
falling transition to the effect transition object. 

Following this, the specification is fully translated, and the resulting STG 
will be the same as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cElement-stg-translated}. 
This can now be used with tools, to verify and synthesize. It can also be
\emph{resynthesized} using these tools, to produce a more compact STG,
such as that seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cElement-stg}

\section{Usage of the tool\label{sec:tool-use}}

\vspace{-1mm}

We will now discuss the design flow, including the preparation of 
a concepts file, the translation methods from within \noun{Workcraft}, and 
the uses of the translated STGs.

\subsection{Concepts file layout \label{sub:file_layout}}

\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\normalsize]{haskell}
module CElement where
import Tuura.Concept.STG

circuit a b c = protocol <> ports 
             <> init 
 where
  protocol = cElement a b c <> env
  env      = inverter c a 
          <> inverter c b
  ports    = inputs[a, b] <> outputs[c] 
  init     = initialise0 [a, b, c]
\end{minted}

\par\end{centering}
%\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{centering}
\protect\caption{\label{fig:concepts_file}A concepts file}
\vspace{-1mm}
\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}

The concepts file we will discuss is found in Figure~\ref{fig:concepts_file}.
Concepts files are an extension of Haskell files, and hence, use the ``.hs'' file extension.
The following describes important information about specific lines.

%\vspace{-1.5mm}

\begin{description}
  \item [Line 1]  This line must be included in all concept files, with the 
  module name chosen by the user.
  
  \item [Line 2] is included so that the built-in operators and existing 
  gates/protocols can be used. 
  
  \item [Line 3] is where a user can begin to define their concepts. 
  ``\texttt{circuit}'' must begin the line for the concept to be translated.
  A user can choose what names they wish to represent their signals.
  
  \item [Line 4] is simply ``\texttt{where}''. This is used to separate the main
  concept definition from other user-defined concepts.

\end{description}

%\vspace{-1mm}

The lines discussed above are the basics of writing concepts. With this 
information, a user can write concept files. We have used the 
C-element with environment example here. We have defined the interface, initial 
state and the operation of this separately, by defining these concepts following the 
``\mintinline{haskell}{where}''. The full circuit specification is then 
composed of all of these defined concepts.

\subsection{Using \noun{Plato} from within \noun{Workcraft} \label{sec:workcraft_usage}}

%\vspace{-4mm}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{centering}
%\vspace{-3mm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{Images/workcraft_design_flow.png}
\par\end{centering}
\begin{centering}
\protect\caption{\label{fig:design_flow_screenshot}\noun{Workcraft} and 
			\noun{Plato} usage.}
\par\end{centering}
\vspace{-5mm}
\end{figure*}

\noun{Plato}, can be used on its own using a command-line interface, and has been
integrated into \noun{Workcraft}, an open-source EDA tool. This can visualise many graphical modeling
methods, including STGs, and also features several other tools integrated, which can perform verification
and synthesis of these models automatically.

STGs are a featured modeling method within \noun{Workcraft},
which can be automatically imported from \noun{Plato}, either from concept specifications written by a user from within 
\noun{Workcraft}, or by importing a previously written concept file. 
This section will discuss how to use \noun{Plato} from within
\noun{Workcraft}.

%\vspace{-3.5mm}
 
\subsubsection{Translating and authoring concepts}

To start specifying and translating concepts, open the concepts dialog.  This is
done from the menu bar, by selecting the ``\emph{Conversion}'' menu, and then
the ``\emph{Translate concepts...}'' option. It will look similar to the dialog 
on the left in Figure~\ref{fig:design_flow_screenshot}.

From within this dialog, one can write their own concepts, from the default 
template provided. One can open an 
existing concepts file, with the \emph{.hs} extension. When satisfied with the 
concepts written, a user can choose to save the file, if not already saved, and
then translate these concepts. Translated concepts will produce an STG in a 
form similar to that on the right in Figure~\ref{fig:design_flow_screenshot}.

Now, a user can choose to insert more 
concepts, make changes to this STG, and once they are satisfied with it, can 
then perform various functions on this STG. One can perform transformations, 
verifications, simulations and synthesis on this STG using the menus within this 
workspace. Any further changes to this STG, based on the results of these 
operations can be made to this STG or to the concepts file. 

\subsubsection{Importing concepts directly}

%\vspace{-3mm}

In \noun{Workcraft} it is also possible to import concepts directly from a file,
without having to view the concepts first. This can be done from the 
``\emph{File}'' menu, by selecting the ``\emph{Import...}'' option. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
%\vspace{-3mm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Images/import_menu_screenshot.png}
\par\end{centering}

\begin{centering}
\protect\caption{\label{fig:import_menu_screenshot}The import menu and the 
			option of \emph{.hs} files.}

\par\end{centering}
\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}

Any concept files imported will be automatically translated to an STG.

\vspace{-2mm}

%\subsection{Errors}
%
%%\vspace{-2mm}
%
%If any errors are encountered during the translation process, \noun{Workcraft} 
%will produce a helpful error message. This usually can tell you with more 
%detail what the issue that is causing the error is, but will ask you to refer 
%to \noun{Workcraft}'s console window for specific line numbers or signals which
%need to be corrected. 
%
%These errors will include whether a signal has not been declared as an input or
%output, a signal has not had it's initial state given, or even that \noun{Plato}
%has not been installed correctly. 

\section{Conclusions and future work\label{sec:conclusions}}

%\vspace{-3mm}

In this work, we have displayed the open-source
tool, \noun{Plato}~\cite{2016_concepts_github}. This tool implements a 
domain-specific language for behavioural concepts, featuring some built-in 
concepts at varying levels, allowing users to specify behaviours in a preferred 
way. 

This tool also features a method of converting concepts into Signal
Transition Graphs, output in a format usable by other existing design, 
verification and synthesis tools. 

\noun{Plato}, can be used on its own using a command-line interface, and is
integrated into \noun{Workcraft}, which can visualise many graphical modeling
methods, including STGs, which can be automatically imported from \noun{Plato}
either from concept specifications written by a user from within 
\noun{Workcraft}, or by importing a previously written concept file.
\noun{Workcraft} also has several verification and synthesis tools 
integrated, which can automatically use STGs translated from concepts. 

Using concepts, a user can reduce the time of designing an asynchronous
control circuit from the ground up, as well as reuse components
by importing them from previously written user concept files which can reduce 
design-time of future projects. Composition of concepts can help
reduce errors and save time in comparison to performing these manually.
This method can help to make asynchronous circuits more appealing
to industrial designers.

%Currently, this method works with Signal Transition Graphs, and
%Finite State Machines~(FSM).

The \noun{Plato} tool we have discussed is available 
from~\cite{2016_concepts_github}, and is included with 
\noun{Workcraft}~\cite{Workcraft_website}. A manual is included with the tool, 
which contains descriptions of the features.
